My name is Daniel. Today's lecture will be about motivation. We will use acorns, a recent term, used to portray words that occur due to miss hearings. Is a difficult subject and every little bit should be explained with detail. Most teachers will enter lectures like a bull in a china shop, careless and narrow minded with their viewpoints. I mix my words because my teaching is beyond approach and there's isn't. This course has cost a great deal which makes me bawl my eyes out when teaching is below standard. It's good to see so many here today. Every single one of you are rapid wolves, hungry for knowledge and ready to complete the course in one fell swoop. From here on in I will turn off the lights and cut the chase. Please turn off all cell phones. Bodies have not passed. We live in a mundane world. But then kill over. Remain strong patient. You must bide your time, be like winter running go with the flow. Then one can see is the best opportunity that comes your way. I like to imagine myself enduring pain during different scenarios. For example walking the days within the desert or climbing a barbed wire fence. Or, even a no holds barred wrestling match. If this fails, or other bad situations obstruct the strategy, try to wangle opportunities instead.
