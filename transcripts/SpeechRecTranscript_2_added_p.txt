My name is Daniel. Today's lecture will be about motivation. We will use acorns, a recent term, used to portray words that occur due to miss hearings. Into difficult subject and every little bit should be explained in detail. Most teachers will enter lectures upon a china shop, careless and arrow minded with their viewpoints. I did mix my words because my teaching is beyond approach and there's isn't. This course has caused a great deal which makes me bawl my eyes out when teaching is below standard. It's good to see so many here today. Every signal one of you rapid wolves, hungry for knowledge and complete the course in one fell swoop. From here and I will turn off the lights and cut to the chase. Please turn off all cell phones. The boring days of not passed. We live in a Monday world. But then kill over. Remain strong patient. Must buy your time be like winter running go with the flow. Then one can cease the best opportunity that comes your way. I like to imagine myself enduring pain during different scenarios. For example, walking days within the desert or climbing a barbed wire fence. Ore, and even fighting a no holds barred wrestling match. If this fails, or rather bad situations obstruct the strategy, try to wangle opportunities instead.
