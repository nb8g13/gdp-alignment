My name is Daniel. Todays lecture will be about motivation. We will use eggcorns, a recent term, used to portray words that occur due to miss hearings. Its a difficult subject and every little bit should be explained with detail. Most teachers will enter lectures like a bull in a china shop, careless and narrow minded with their view points. I dont mince my words because my teaching is beyond reproach and there's isn't. This course has cost a great deal which makes me bawl my eyes out when teaching is below standard.

It's good to see many here today. Every single one of you are rabid wolves, hungry for knowledge and ready to complete the course in one fell swoop. From here on in I will turn off the lights and cut to the chase. Please turn off all cell phones.

The boring days have not passed. We live in a mundane world. But dont keel over. Remain strong and patient. You must bide your time, be like a wind turbine and go with the flow. Then one can seize the best oppurtunity that comes your way.

I like to imagine myself enduring pain during different scenarios. For example walking for days within the dessert or climbing a barbed wire fence. Oh, and even fighting a no holds barred wrestling match.

If this fails, or other bad situations obstruct this strategy, try to wangle opportunities instead.
